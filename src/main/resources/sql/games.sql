His father Aeson, the king, was dethroned by Pelias, the king’s brother. The usurper Pelias gave Aeson his word that when Jason will come of age, he will give crown and throne to the young prince, but that was a promise he did not intend to keep. When Jason, a young man now, confronted Pelias and asked him to honor his word, the usurper tasked Jason with a seemingly impossible quest to prove that he is worthy of the throne of Iolkos. He had to recover the Golden Fleece from the distant city of Kolchis. Jason accepted and sent word to famous heroes to aid him in his quest. Hercules, Orpheus, the brothers Kastor and Polydefkis, Laertes the father of Ulysses, were some of the 50 heroes who answered Jason’s call and joined him in his noble quest on board the legendary ship Argo. Argonauts is a cooperative game that requires careful strategic planning and just a bit of luck, as even the best laid plans, can fall victim to the wrath of the Gods. The game’s objectives are to acquire the Golden Fleece and return safely to Iolkos without losing Argo or too many members of her crew. Each player controls heroes that participated in the Argonaut campaign, each with his / her own set of skills and special abilities. Following the journey from the myth, the Argonauts must face mythical monsters like Scylla and Harybdis, Harpies, Sirens, the construct Talos and the dragon guarding the Fleece, not to mention the perilous journey full of lethal encounters with merciless pirates or having to weather destructive thunderstorms all the while making sure their cargo hold is well stocked with the necessary supplies for the journey to and from Kolchis and their ship sea-worthy. Each turn, the players must decide which of their characters will participate in the encounter they face, dealing with threats with either might or cunning and keeping in mind that these characters will be unavailable to face the next encounter due to exhaustion.

These cards have many different powers and you can create powerful combination to earn gold (the help of the gods) and victory points (the favor of the gods). Each card belongs to one of the eight Olympians gods (a family), and shows a level (1 to 3). During the five turns of the game, players will try to transfer their cards to the Elysium and write their own Legends, which are series of cards from the same family or from different families of the same level.

Traits like Hard Shell and Horns will protect your species from Carnivores, while a Long Neck will help them get food that others cannot reach. With over 4,000 ways to evolve your species, every game becomes a different adventure. Evolution packs a surprising amount of variety for a game with simple rules. The variety comes from the synergies between the trait cards and from the different personalities at the table. Some players thrive on creating Carnivores to wreak havoc on their fellow players. Others prefer to stay protected and mind their own business. Evolution encourages both play styles by giving each of them multiple paths to victory. And it is the mix of play styles at the table that ultimately determines the eco-system in which the player are adapting.

Madeira, the Portuguese word for wood, refers to the dense forest that covered its wild, fertile landscape. This, and its strategic position far into the Atlantic Ocean made the island one of the most significant Portuguese discoveries. Madeira served as a laboratory for what would become the Portuguese Empire. Wheat plantations were the first means for survival on the island. After that, when D. Henrique decided to increase the economy of the Empire, sugar became the core business of Madeira. Once sugar started coming from other places in the world, such as Africa and Brazil, profits from sugar were no longer enough, and production of the very famous Madeira wine became the most important economic product of the island. Players try to adapt themselves to these constraints, working to find better fields for farming the right goods and for obtaining precious wood, essential for erecting new structures in the cities and for building ships. In turn, the ships are crucial for trading in foreign markets, as well as for taking part in new expeditions to discover other countries. Madeira has been established just as it was in the original administrative division of the island under 3 captaincies (Funchal, Machico, and Porto Santo), where the ultimate goal is to develop the Island, gaining the most prestige under and for the Portuguese Crown.", 38, 17, null, "Madeira", "Civilization", null, "Nuno Bizarro Sentieiro", "2-4", "120 minutes", "Strategy game", "14 and up", null);
